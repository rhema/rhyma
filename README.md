### Live demo: http://infovisu.com/sand/rhyma-master/sandbox/rhyme/example.html


Rhyma is an effort to create a client side javascript rhyming library. Instead of using a database, Rhyma loads two json dictionaries: the cmu pronunciation dictionary http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/cgi-bin/cmudict and a term dictionary (home brewed from Google's n-gram data https://github.com/rhema?tab=repositories).



Note:
To run the example in a browser it must be served via HTTP.
For development, I use:
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
